<h2> Find precious info about New York </h2>

<p class="descriere"> The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of about 302.6 square miles (784 km2), New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term New York minute. Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. </p>
<p class="descriere"> In recent years, important aspects of the American metropolis became more and more attractive. Culture, traditions, myths and all kinds of stories, all blend together to provide a marvellous experience for the foreign visitors. Just take an example, Times Square kept its fundamentals, while adding some of the cultural that trend nowadays. Good decision by the New York's officials, because the number of European visitors has seen an exponential growth from 2014 to the present. Security is another crucial aspect to discuss, let's just say New York heavily improved on that.</p>
<p class="descriere">According to NYC & Company, the official destination marketing organization for the city, the top producing countries for international visitors to New York City in 2011 were the United Kingdom (1,055,000), Canada (1,033,000), Brazil (718,000), France (662,000), Germany (587,000), Australia (532,000), Italy (495,000), China (427,000), Spain (422,000), Mexico (376,000), and Japan (299,000).[7] With the exception of slight peaks around Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year, visitor arrival rates are roughly the same year-round. New York has one of the highest hotel-occupancy rates in the country. Arrivals have remained relatively high even since the global economic crisis, due to heavy discounting and value-added pricing. </p>
