<h3 class="subtitlu" id="inceput"> How it started </h3>
<div class="text" id="caseta1">
<p class="despre"> The place where all started, that place is called <b> Brasov </b>. That's the place where the CEO of YorkField was born. He is known by his fictional name, Lawrence R. That's only his scene name, the real name is Silviu Ifrim. At that time, Silviu Ifrim didn't mean anything to anybody. Why? Because he was just an insignificant face in the whole college. He didn't have many friends either, but he didn't lack the social side. It's good to mention that he <i>loved </i> all the people he cared of. And those weren't many, maybe 3 or 4. He was 18. 
<br><br>
 By then, he exploited his free time by useless activities like gaming, more gaming, and even more gaming. That had ended, and he realised what matters in life. We are all <b> different </b>, so mentioning what he realised is pointless. Everyone has to realise that for themselves, it's the most efficient way. 
 <br><br>
 The summer of 2016 was one of the best he had ever had. It was filled with moments that made him realise that personal development and good friends are all important.  It started pretty bad, as he thought he was sick of appendicitis. Fortunately, that was just a false alarm. 
 <br><br>
 From then, he started running at least 3 kilometers everyday. After the running, he proposed himself to learn the technics he'll need next year at highschoool. I'm talking about web development, mainly of HTML & CSS, because those are the obligatory start for everyone. <b> Everyday </b>, from 1 July to 25 July he learnt many useful things. On 25 June he went to the seaside with his friends and some new persons, who prooved to be valuable ones indeed. It was an inspiring experience that made him become conscious about the social part. In fact, try not to fall on the wrong side of tracks. The ideal situation is to keep a balance between geek activities and social life. Both are very important.
 <br><br>
 After returning to Brasov, he continued his activities like running and learning. Those were alternated, of course, with full age celebration parties. Those were a good addition to his life, as he was on a continuous cycle of learning and experiencing. The summer of 2016 ended, it was one of the best summers in his whole life.
<br><br>
 Maybe the best.

<h3 class="subtitlu" id="continuare" > Clich√© continuation </h3> 
<div class="text" id="caseta2">
<p class="despre"> The highschool was over. It was something special, something he will never meet again in his life from then on. Basically, it was a forward step in life, a big one. He passed the exams with good grades and attended to the <i> Applied Informatics </i> university. Everything was on plan. At the university, he started to learn new programming techniques like procedural programming, object-oriented programming ; new programming languages like Python and JavaScript which are object-oriented too. Also, machine learning was part of the program. But let's not dig into these details, because I don't think many of you are interested. 
<br><br>
After the first year of university, he gained a lot of information. Later on, he decided to put his skills in practice. The internet was full of good ideas, but he tried to make something different. Lawrence focused on gaining lots of informations about cities like New York, his second favourite city, after Brasov. Also, he bought a cheap DSLR camera (the Canon EOS 700D) to take useful pictures. He knew that the York-trip was just a dream, because he didn't have the best financial background. Why should we resign about our dreams when we <b> could </b> make them become real? His HTML & CSS knowledge was at its best, and he also learnt a modern framwork, Bootstrap. 
<br><br>
Using those, he created his very first website. Its name was Brasovwood. It was containing beautiful pictures, lots of information and most important, a pleasant design. But that was not enough, as the site was static and its back-end functions didn't work at all. Lawrence learned PHP and tied his SQL database to the website, so the people visiting it could interact with it, as well. Later, he introduced forms, and fully redesigned the website to a more modern look. Also, the site became responsive, as it looked in the same great way, no matter the device (phone,tablet,computer, MAC). 
<br><br>
IBM observed his great dedication to work, so they proposed him a free internship on a period of 6 months to the United States of America, New York. Wasn't that amazing? Sometimes, <i> dreams come true </i>. There, he met Chris Capposela, a guy with similar interests. He also met Charles Calthrop, a young guy from England, who was specialised in computing. 
<br><br>
They associated. </p> </div>

<h3 class="subtitlu" id="continuat"> A story of success </h3>
<div class="text" id="caseta3"> 
<p class="despre"> At first, New York life seemed to be perfect. But Lawrence found a big issue, their culture and way of thinking were totally different from what he had learnt about Romania. That was a big issue because most employers required cultural and historical knowledge, for <i>unknown </i> reasons. Also, the americans were so different, there is a huge gap between them and the romanians. His first friends, Chris and Charles helped him understand better their traditions and culture as they were going to different locations to relax after the big work. 
<br><br>
One night, they went to a club called <i> 'Cent </i> where they had a great time. Indeed, the club reminded Lawrence of <i> Megadiscoteca Tineretului </i>, the club he had visited in the summer of 2016. He met Amanda (or Anda) Wayne, and they got to talk about geek stuff in the club, as he found out that she was a programmer, too. After that night, they associated with Anda, who came with the idea to name the website <i> YorkField </i>. The name was inspired by Intel's roadmap of processors, because many series of the Core sub-architecture had a <i> field </i> at the word's ending. Take some examples : Lynnfield, Bloomfield.
