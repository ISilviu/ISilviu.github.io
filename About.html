<h3 class="subtitlu" id="inceput"> How it started </h3>
<div class="text" id="caseta1">
<p class="despre"> The place where all started, that place is called <b> Brasov </b>. That's the place where the CEO of YorkField was born. He is known by his fictional name, Lawrence R. That's only his scene name, the real name is Silviu Ifrim. At that time, Silviu Ifrim didn't mean anything to anybody. Why? Because he was just an insignificant face in the whole college. He didn't have many friends either, but he didn't lack the social side. It's good to mention that he <i>loved </i> all the people he cared of. And those weren't many, maybe 3 or 4. He was 18. 
<br><br>
 By then, he exploited his free time by useless activities like gaming, more gaming, and even more gaming. That had ended, and he realised what matters in life. We are all <b> different </b>, so mentioning what he realised is pointless. Everyone has to realise that for themselves, it's the most efficient way. 
 <br><br>
 The summer of 2016 was one of the best he had ever had. It was filled with moments that made him realise that personal development and good friends are all important.  It started pretty bad, as he thought he was sick of appendicitis. Fortunately, that was just a false alarm. 
 <br><br>
 From then, he started running at least 3 kilometers everyday. After the running, he proposed himself to learn the technics he'll need next year at highschoool. I'm talking about web development, mainly of HTML & CSS, because those are the obligatory start for everyone. <b> Everyday </b>, from 1 July to 25 July he learnt many useful things. On 25 June he went to the seaside with his friends and some new persons, who prooved to be valuable ones indeed. It was an inspiring experience that made him become conscious about the social part. In fact, try not to fall on the wrong side of tracks. The ideal situation is to keep a balance between geek activities and social life. Both are very important.
 <br><br>
 After returning to Brasov, he continued his activities like running and learning. Those were alternated, of course, with full age celebration parties. Those were a good addition to his life, as he was on a continuous cycle of learning and experiencing. The summer of 2016 ended, it was one of the best summers in his whole life.
<br><br>
 Maybe the best.
