<p class="despre"> Totul a luat naștere la Brașov, unde doi prieteni foarte buni, cu hobby-uri comune (fotografia, respectiv web-development-ul) au decis

 By then, he exploited his free time by useless activities like gaming, more gaming, and even more gaming. That had ended, and he realised what matters in life. We are all <b> different </b>, so mentioning what he realised is pointless. Everyone has to realise that for themselves, it's the most efficient way.

<h3 class="subtitlu" id="continuare" > Cliché continuation </h3> 
<div class="text" id="caseta2">
<p class="despre"> The highschool was over. It was something special, something he will never meet again in his life from then on. Basically, it was a forward step in life, a big one. He passed the exams with good grades and attended to the <i> Applied Informatics </i> university. Everything was on plan. At the university, he started to learn new programming techniques like procedural programming, object-oriented programming ; new programming languages like Python and JavaScript which are object-oriented too. Also, machine learning was part of the program. But let's not dig into these details, because I don't think many of you are interested. 
<br><br>
After the first year of university, he gained a lot of information. Later on, he decided to put his skills in practice. The internet was full of good ideas, but he tried to make something different. Lawrence focused on gaining lots of informations about cities like New York, his second favourite city, after Brasov. Also, he bought a cheap DSLR camera (the Canon EOS 700D) to take useful pictures. He knew that the York-trip was just a dream, because he didn't have the best financial background. Why should we resign about our dreams when we <b> could </b> make them become real? His HTML & CSS knowledge was at its best, and he also learnt a modern framwork, Bootstrap. 
<br><br>
Using those, he created his very first website. Its name was Brasovwood. It was containing beautiful pictures, lots of information and most important, a pleasant design. But that was not enough, as the site was static and its back-end functions didn't work at all. Lawrence learned PHP and tied his SQL database to the website, so the people visiting it could interact with it, as well. Later, he introduced forms, and fully redesigned the website to a more modern look. Also, the site became responsive, as it looked in the same great way, no matter the device (phone,tablet,computer, MAC). 
<br><br>
IBM observed his great dedication to work, so they proposed him a free internship on a period of 6 months to the United States of America, New York. Wasn't that amazing? Sometimes, <i> dreams come true </i>. There, he met Chris Capposela, a guy with similar interests. He also met Charles Calthrop, a young guy from England, who was specialised in computing. 
<br><br>
They associated. </p> </div>

<h3 class="subtitlu" id="continuat"> A story of success </h3>
<div class="text" id="caseta3"> 
<p class="despre"> At first, New York life seemed to be perfect. But Lawrence found a big issue, their culture and way of thinking were totally different from what he had learnt about Romania. That was a big issue because most employers required cultural and historical knowledge, for <i>unknown </i> reasons. Also, the americans were so different, there is a huge gap between them and the romanians. His first friends, Chris and Charles helped him understand better their traditions and culture as they were going to different locations to relax after the big work. 
<br><br>
One night, they went to a club called <i> 'Cent </i> where they had a great time. Indeed, the club reminded Lawrence of <i> Megadiscoteca Tineretului </i>, the club he had visited in the summer of 2016. He met Amanda (or Anda) Wayne, and they got to talk about geek stuff in the club, as he found out that she was a programmer, too. After that night, they associated with Anda, who came with the idea to name the website <i> YorkField </i>. The name was inspired by Intel's roadmap of processors, because many series of the Core sub-architecture had a <i> field </i> at the word's ending. Take some examples : Lynnfield, Bloomfield.
